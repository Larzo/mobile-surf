 You can access this website from a cell phone to get buoy reports, just use the <br/>
 same URL you typed in to get to this page from your browser on your cell phone. <br/>
 I've got a good  number of buoys for the east and west coast. I actually started this up myself as <br/>
 an interesting project to improve my development skills and so I could check the buoys using my cell phone.

 I am a software engineer working in PHP, though Ruby On Rails (a newer up and coming <br/>
 web development language and framework) is what really interests me. I also spend alot <br/> 
 of time camping near the seashore and enjoy surfing, mostly in southern Maine for the <br/>
 last couple of years.

 Well, I somehow  wrecked my weather radio, maybe I dropped it or it was moisture <br/>
 that did it. Radio Shack is now trying to sell these expensive weather radios that <br/>
 I don't really like. I bought this cell phone that can access wml web sites. Since <br/>
 most cell phones don't have alot of bandwidth, these sites are not html but wml. <br/>
 Having a couple days of vacation, here I am up in Wells Maine spending a few days to <br/>
 get this Rails site up. I use it alot as I like to check the buoys without getting out <br/>
 of bed and turning on my laptop, or if I am just out and about. Often when I am camping or <br/>
 travelling, I may not have regular internet access anyway.

</p>
<br/>
feel free to contact me with any feedback, or if you'd like some buoys added, etc. <br/>
I set up a yahoo email for this site, I may not check all the time so please <br/>
be patient ... <br/> <br/>
